# Speak Up - Start speaking to make change start

### 1. Description
Speak Up is a mobile English Chat application which helps you improve your communication skills (speaking & listening) by giving you short conversations with other users anytime you're free. The main idea is to connect two users in the same level, give them a topic that both interested in and then they make a conversation about it.

- Assign user to the level: beginner, intermediate, advance
- Choose topics that they are interested in 
- Finish sign up

- Open app
- Show main menu which includes: 
  - Start a random conversation (core feature), 
  - Explore great conversations done by other users,
  - Practice pronunciation, 
  - Conversation samples (common use-case by level: greeting, interview, presentation...)
  
#### Flow for random conversation feature:
Start a converstation -> Send a request, find other available users (in the same level) -> Random choose one -> Connect to chosen user (conversation can be audio only or video chat) -> Give they a topic -> Users talk about the topic -> Record the conversation -> Conversation finish -> Give user the recored audio/video.

#### Paid features:
- Conversation review: Want to review your conversation and then get feedback -> Send review request -> Select reviewer -> Check their pay requirement (free or how much) -> Reviewer reivew & make a summary report -> Discuss about the conversation & give feedback, mistake correct
